Project 00: 
This project was a really effective way to introduce and how to run a block of code 
in SpaceMacs. We all thought it would have been effective if we were first shown 
how to get C++ and Python working in SpaceMacs. We figured out how to run blocks 
of code using elisp, learned diffrent terms and vocabulary involving dicrete 
mathematics, how to use loops and, and how don't care and state machine pay a role 
in hardware secuity issues.
